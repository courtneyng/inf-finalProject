            <h3 class="subhead">Login</h3>
                <p>Login is very simple, it is your NetID and password.</p>
            <h3 class="subhead">Grades</h3>
                <p>You can check your grades on the left under tools. You can also check by clicking on the dropdown in the top
                    right corner and then clicking the icon with the paper and check plus. You can click each individual class to 
                    see the grades for each assignment once you get there.You might get scared seeing your grade be listed as "16.00" 
                    but when you click it might be 16/16 or 16/18 etc. Don't worry, it probably isn't a 16/100.                    
                </p>
            <h2 class="head1">Security</h2>

            <dl>
                <dt>Two-Factor Authentication</dt>
                  <dd>- Two-Factor Authentication is a way to prevent the risk of possible attacks on your accounts.
                    Some use another biometric (a part of the body) such as fingerprint, facial recognition, or 
                    voice recognition. Some may send a message to a trusted device or a combination of letters and 
                    numbers to enter.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Password Manager</dt>
                  <dd>- A password manager saves all your passwords and allows you to set many different difficult passwords
                    without you having to remember them. It is harder for hackers to guess many different passwords instead
                    of getting into all accounts associated with your email/number with your one password with variations.
                </dd>
                <dt>Creating a strong password</dt>
                  <dd>- It is usually recommended that you have at least 1 special character, 1 captialized letter, 1 number,
                    and be at least 8 characters long.
                </dd>

            <h2 class="head1">Communication</h2>
            <h3 class="subhead">Zoom</h3>
                <p>You log into your Zoom by choosing the SSO option. It will bring you to a screen that has a fill in box.
                    in the box you would put "albany" and it will send you to a webpage that asks you to input your NetID and
                    password.

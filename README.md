# inf-finalProject
The final project for my INF201 class, create a website on anything.

-Must have at least 3 pages

This website is supposed to be a hub for students to use instead of the official ualbany website.
It is more centered around specific resources for the students as well as IT help that is more digestable to the
average student. While obviously not completely polished and clean, it still has a lot of information. 

In a later version of the project, I will be revamping and creating a new website that is completely polished and ready to use.
